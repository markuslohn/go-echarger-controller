# go-echarger-controller
The goal of this project is to intelligently and fully automatically charge my electric vehicle using only the surplus energy generated by my solar system.

I am using a go-eCharger Wallbox, which unfortunately is not directly compatible with my current battery storage system and inverter.

Therefore, I am developing an independent control system for the wallbox based on the real-time data provided by the storage system. Communication between the wallbox and the storage system is implemented using the Modbus protocol.

Technical focus:
- Independent control of charging based on solar surplus production
- Modbus communication with storage system and wallbox
- Objective: Optimal utilization of solar energy for vehicle charging
